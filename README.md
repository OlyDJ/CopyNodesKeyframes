COPY NODES KEYFRAMES - Blender Addon

Duplicate any node with keyframes. Are you tired of copying any node, and have to manually copy and paste the keyframes? You will save a lot of time with Copy Nodes Keyframes. 

Support for Blender 3.3 +

- Duplicate any node with keyframes.
- Duplicate selected nodes (all at once). 
- Duplicate any group with keyframes.
- (Experimental) Option to move new node with mouse (Similar to "Duplicate" native Blender option).

Known Issues

- Keyframes on Colors (like Color Ramp) have a bug where keyframes are created, but color values in some keyframes is wrong. It will be fixed in next release. (BTW, even with that you will save a lot of time)

Why I created CNK?

When you need to duplicate a node with its keyframes, it's ok to follow the "regular" way (I do not understand why it is not yet implemented). Duplicate the node, copy keyframes from original nodes, and paste them into the new one. But what when you need, let's say, to duplicate 10 nodes at the same time? You duplicate them, and one by one you must go through the "regular steps". What a waste of time... 

How to use it?

Just select one or more nodes with keyframes, and press OSkey + D (I work on Mac). If you use Windows or Linux, just go to Blender - Preferences - Keymap, Node Editor - Node Editor (Global), and change Copy Nodes Keyframes shortcut as you will.
In the Sidebar you will find a button with the same functionality. Thats all!

How to install this addon:

- Download the zip file.
- Open Blender and go to Edit - Preferences
- Go to Add-ons Tab.
- Press Install button, and search for the downloaded zip file.
- Select it and press Install
- Just click the box to enable it and you are ready to go.

Hope you enjoy it!!!
